Add comprehensive experiment data collection and visualization

This commit adds a complete data collection and visualization system for all
three core experiments, enabling paper-ready figures and detailed numerical
results.

What changed:
- Added run_experiments_with_visualization.py: Enhanced experiment runner
  that collects detailed metrics and generates publication-quality figures
- Added generate_paper_figures.py: Quick script to generate all paper figures
- Added comprehensive documentation:
  * EXPERIMENT_VISUALIZATION_README.md: Usage guide
  * EXPERIMENT_RESULTS_TEMPLATE.md: Paper results template
  * EXPERIMENT_DATA_COMPLETE.md: Completion report
- Updated requirements.txt: Added matplotlib and seaborn for visualization

Features:
- Automatic data collection for all three experiments
- High-quality visualization (PNG, 300 DPI) with 4 subplots per experiment
- JSON export for complete numerical data
- CSV export for summary tables (LaTeX-ready)
- Success/failure validation for each experiment
- Paper integration guide with LaTeX code examples

Experiments covered:
1. Privacy Kill Switch: Privacy vs general error ratios, alpha sweep
2. Saving the Genius: Quantization levels, relative preservation
3. Dual Differential Privacy: Epsilon sweep, utility ratios

All figures are publication-ready and can be directly included in papers.
Results are saved to experiments/results/ with timestamps.

Fixes:
- Fixed NameError in save_results() (results -> self.results)
- Replaced Unicode checkmarks with ASCII (PASS/FAIL) to avoid font warnings

Tested: Script runs successfully and generates all expected outputs.
